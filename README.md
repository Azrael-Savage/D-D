# D&D Character Generator

## Description
- This is a full stack website that allows a user to create an account, log in, create a D&D Character, save it to a database and keep up to date on current D&D news!

- As we went through this project the biggest impact was learning how to work as a group, using Git and how to set up a project. We were tasked to work with multiple restAPI's and know to use their information to integrate with eachother in order to get results for the nearest breweries, and to save the returned information into local storage. The layout was built using the Bulma css framework with our project, a CSS framework other than bootstrap.
